## Project

This repository is a sub-repository of [https://github.com/hellokvn/jp-api](https://github.com/hellokvn/jp-api).

## Description

Instead of setting up every single AWS service by its [Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), I prefer to write the AWS infrastructure fully by code, based on Terraform. Itâ€™s just easier to scale and potential contributors love this approach. 

## Installation

```bash
Create file: terraform.tfvars
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

## Frameworks

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.
